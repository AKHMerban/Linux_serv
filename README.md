# Linux-server

"Working on the Linux server project, tackling DHCP, DNS, and virtual machine setup, has truly been a cool adventure. 
I'm incredibly grateful for the support and collaboration from an amazing team. 
A special shout-out to Mathieu, aka Nox, and Mohammed for their guidance, and a big thank you to Younes, Aziz, Ashraf, Rubben, Hamza, and everyone else whose contributions made this project possibleâ€”even those I may not have mentioned by name. 
Your teamwork and dedication made this journey unforgettable!"
